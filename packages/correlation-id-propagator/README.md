# @parker/correlation-id-propagator

Helps you propagate correlation ids - an id that can be put into all logs for the same unit of work (e.g. an HTTP request), to make it easy to filter for all logs related to that unit of work.

See the README for `@parker/context-propagation` for an explanation of how context propagation works, in general.
