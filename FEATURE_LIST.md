# Feature List

What am I planning to build next?

1. Expose "list spots closest to point" as an endpoint
2. Create a mega-simple "landlord" app, that lets you list a parking spot
  - Just a location to start
    - Pricing, pics, hours, etc. can come later
  - Maybe to start, just hard-code the owner id?  Or a hacky login page that just creates a user every time?
3. Create a mega-simple "parker" app, that lets you book a parking spot
  - Also hack users to start
4. Setup proper accounts
  - Using something like Keycloak or Ory Kratos
