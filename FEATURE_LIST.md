# Feature List

What am I planning to work on next?

- Create a mega-simple "landlord" app, that lets you list a parking spot
  - Just a location to start (pricing, pics, hours, etc. can come later)
  - Maybe to start, just hard-code the owner id? Or a hacky login page that just creates a user every time?
- Create a mega-simple "parker" app, that lets you book a parking spot
  - Also hack users to start
- Setup proper accounts
  - Using something like Keycloak or Ory Kratos
- Eliminate Prisma (which is now migrations only), add new migrations
- Convert errors created by NestJS pipes to be nice Parker errors
